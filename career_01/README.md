1) I was attended JavaScript meetup from STLJS on December 7,2017 at 5:30pm.

2)They talked about available new features in JavaScript.

  * JavaScript features within ES6.
  * the language continuous evolvement and expansion under Ecma TC39.
  * Two features were quietly added for ES2016.
  * In January, the committee marked another handful of improvements final the release of ES2017.

3) I was asked the below questions to the group.

  * How is the JavaScript in the Market?
  * What other frameworks I need to learn other than traditional JavaScript?

4) Continuing learn about the topic - they were suggested to learn Angular.js and React.js as the future completely       revolves around these.
